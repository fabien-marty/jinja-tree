# jinja-tree

## What is it?

`jinja-tree` is a CLI utility to process [jinja (jinja2)](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates
recursively in a directory tree.

It is very configurable and very easy to extend with its included plugin system.

The default behavior is to recursively search for files with a given extension (`.template` for example) and to process the context with [jinja (jinja2)](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates engine reading the context variables from:

- a configuration file
- environment variables 
- dotenv files 

Then, the processed content is written into another file with the same name/path but with the configured extension (`.template` by default) removed. The original file can also be deleted (but this is not the default behavior).

> If you want a full example about overall operation, you can find an [example here](docs/details-about-overall-operation.md).

## What's it for?

Your imagination is your limit üòÖ but it's very useful for maintaining DRY documentation (for example: `your-cli --help` output automatically updated in a markdown file), configuration files with default values read in code, included common blocks in different files...

**So it's a great tool for maintaining repositories in general.**

> - [getting a reference TOML configuration file rendered with defaults values read from code](docs/fixme)

## Features

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Easy to extend 

`jinja-tree` includes a plugin system. You can override the default behavior with your own plugins.

There is two extension points:

- context plugins: to provide context variables to jinja templates
- file plugins: to change the way how `jinja-tree` find files to process (including target files)

See [this specification documentation page](docs/fixme) for more details.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Very configurable

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Embedded extensions

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Full Jinja / Jinja2 support (including "includes" and "inheritance")

## Installation

`pip install jinja-tree`

A docker image will also be available soon üïí

## CLI options

```
$ jinja-tree --help 
"python3 jinja_tree/infra/controller/cli_tree.py --help"|shell()
```

## Bonus

Another CLI utility is provided to process a Jinja template given as stdin: 


```console
$ export FOO=bar
$ echo "Hello {{FOO}}" | jinja-stdin
Hello bar
```


Full help of this bonus CLI utility:

```
$ jinja-stdin --help 
"python3 jinja_tree/infra/controller/cli_stdin.py --help"|shell()
```
